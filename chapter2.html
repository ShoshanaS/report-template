    <p class="introtext">To understand how policy change can save lives from suicide, it’s important to grasp how this public health crisis affects our population and why firearm access plays such an outsized role. This chapter will describe:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The immense scope and impact of suicide in America: Millions of Americans are affected by suicide each year.</li>
      <li>Deadly recent trends in US suicide rates: Suicide rates have steadily and rapidly increased across nearly all states and demographic groups since 2000.</li>
      <li>The impulsive nature of most suicide attempts: Suicide attempts are usually carried out with little planning during acute crisis periods.</li>
      <li>The unique lethality of guns: Compared to other methods commonly used in the US, guns are far more likely to lethalize a suicide attempt.</li>
      <li>The vast disparities in suicide rates that exist across the US: Suicide rates are much, much higher in states and demographic groups where people have easy access to guns.</li>
      <li>The fundamental importance of hope: Suicide prevention works because the prognosis for most suicidal people is hopeful.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Scope and Impact: Millions of Americans Are Affected by Suicide Each Year</h2>
    <p>The stigma and silence that commonly surround the topic of suicide tend to conceal the true scope and impact of this national public health crisis. Every year millions of Americans struggle with mental health conditions and suicidal thoughts that are symptomatic of those conditions. More than a million people every year act on those suicidal impulses and a staggering number are lost to suicide.</p>
    <h3>Mental Health Conditions Are Much More Common than Popularly Believed</h3>
    <p>Because mental illness is so rarely disclosed or discussed, it’s common to underestimate the number of people who grapple with mental health conditions over the course of their lives. Though often undiagnosed, nearly half of all Americans experience a mental illness at some point in their lives. According to CDC data, approximately one in five adults in the United States experiences a diagnosable mental illness in a given year—ranging from depression and anxiety to schizophrenia or PTSD. That means more Americans experience mental illness each year than contract the flu. Some people develop chronic or lifelong mental illnesses, while others experience shorter-term impairments.</p>
    <p>Severe mood and anxiety disorders affect a more concentrated, but still large number of Americans. In a single year:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Approximately 10.5 million American adults and 2 million adolescents experience a major depressive episode that severely impairs their activities for at least two weeks.</li>
      <li>About 5 million adults experience severe bipolar disorder.</li>
      <li>Over 3 million adults experience severe PTSD symptoms lasting more than a month.</li>
      <li>About 2.5 million adults experience severe generalized anxiety disorder for at least six months, severe panic disorder, or schizophrenia.</li>
      <li>Over 3.5 million adults grapple with Dysthymic Disorder, characterized by chronic low-level depressive symptoms that have lasted for at least two years.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of these conditions are significant risk factors for suicide.</p>
    <h3>Millions of Americans Have Grappled with Suicidal Thoughts or Attempted Suicide</h3>
    <p>It’s also common to underestimate how many people experience suicidal thoughts or impulses. The CDC estimates that in a single year, more than 9 million Americans experience “serious thoughts of suicide.” More than 1.3 million attempt suicide. And over half a million have to be hospitalized or treated in emergency rooms for life-threatening, intentional self-injuries. Up to 5% of the US population— 16 million people alive today—have survived a suicide attempt. That’s millions more people than live in large states like Illinois or Pennsylvania.</p>
    <h3>More than Half a Million Americans Have Died by Suicide Since 2000</h3>
    <p>Suicide impacts a staggering number of American families. From 2000 to 2015, over 575,000 Americans died by suicide. A little more than half—nearly 300,000 people—died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. None of these counts include the even larger numbers of men, women, and children for whom a cause of death was undetermined, unreported, or misclassified as an accident.</p>
    <p>Suicide is now our nation’s leading cause of both injury deaths and firearm fatalities, claiming more lives than motor vehicle crashes, falls, accidental drug overdoses, and murders. Forty percent of Americans knew at least one person who died by suicide and more than one-third say another person’s suicide had a significant personal impact on their lives;  28% of Americans knew at least one person who took their own life with a gun.</p>
    <p>Suicide affects all age-groups: from 2000 to 2015, more than 17,000 minors died by suicide before their 18th birthday. Over 9,000 minors intentionally shot themselves over this period. Suicide is now the third leading cause of death among children aged 10–14, the second leading cause of death among young people aged 15–34, and the fourth leading cause of death overall for all males under 65.</p>
    <blockquote>In recent years, more teenagers and young adults have died from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease <i>combined.</i></blockquote>
    <p>Minors are more likely to <i>attempt</i> suicide than adults, but because they are much more likely to survive a suicide attempt, they have lower rates of suicide overall. This is in large part because adults have greater access to guns and are much more likely to use guns when attempting suicide., However, because young people are less likely to die from illness and other causes, suicide is an even more significant factor in their mortality rates. In recent years, more teenagers and young adults have died from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease combined. Suicide is particularly widespread among LGBT Americans, especially LGBT youth, and among military veterans, who comprise about 6% of the population but up to 22% of reported suicide deaths. 
    </p>
    <p>If a disease or terror attacks claimed 44,000 American lives per year, the nation would be gripped with outrage, panic, and urgent demands for a comprehensive response. Stigma and misconceptions about suicide usually keep this enormous public health crisis out of our headlines and policy discussions, but suicide deaths are no less devastating. Suicide is a leading cause of preventable death and suffering in our country and it demands a comprehensive policy response.</p>
    <p>That is especially true because this immense problem is growing worse by the year.
    </p>
    <h3>Deadly Recent Trends: Suicide rates have steadily and rapidly increased across nearly all US states and demographic groups since 2000</h3>
    <p>In recent years, suicide rates have been surging across the US. After falling by 17% between 1985 and 2000, US suicide rates started rising with the new millennium, increasing by 27% between 2000 and 2015, up to the highest levels in at least 35 years. This trend stands in sharp contrast to most other industrialized nations, where suicide rates have steadily declined over the past decade.
    </p>
    <p>Since 2000, American suicide rates have spiked among every age group between the ages of 10 and 80 and nearly every racial and gender category. The increase has been sharpest among girls aged 10 to 14, whose suicide rate, while still comparatively low, has more than doubled., Veterans’ suicide rates have risen by more than one-third. Active duty Army soldiers’ suicide rates tripled within just one decade.</p>
    <p>Suicide rates have also risen in nearly every corner of the country, increasing in 48 out of 50 states since 2000. The rates jumped by over a third in 23 states—nearly half the country—led by a 68% increase in North Dakota and Wyoming. Along with rising mortality rates from alcohol-related diseases and accidental drug overdoses, rising suicide rates have driven down some demographic groups’ average life expectancy, including middle-aged white Americans—an almost unprecedented development in the history of our nation. As discussed below, those with access to guns have been disproportionately affected.</p>
    <p>This enormous loss of life will continue, and will likely worsen, unless our leaders adopt the proven, responsible public policy solutions we know can reverse these trends and  save lives.</p>
    <h4>[insert table A here]</h4>
    <h2>The Impulsive Nature of Most Suicide Attempts: 
    Suicide attempts are usually carried out with little planning during acute crisis periods</h2>
    <p>An all-too-common myth about suicide is that people who attempt it have reached a deliberate point of no return—that they are determined to die by any means and despite anyone’s best efforts. This assumption is not just false, but toxic. It frustrates effective prevention efforts and justifies apathy and inaction in the face of widespread pain and loss.</p>
    <p>Research shows that suicide attempts are typically impulsive, desperate responses to immediate stressors—an argument, a breakup, the death of a loved one. Though underlying risk factors, such as depression, anxiety, trauma, or substance abuse, make a person much more likely to experience suicidal thoughts and impulses, people often only experience those thoughts and impulses during brief and acute crisis periods. During these crisis periods, people typically act on suicidal impulses quickly and with little planning.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A leading study of patients who survived nearly lethal suicide attempts found that 24% had attempted suicide within five minutes of deciding to do so, 48% attempted suicide within 20 minutes of deciding to do so, and 71% attempted suicide within one hour.</li>
      <li>Another study similarly found that 40% harmed themselves within five minutes of deciding to attempt suicide, 48% did so within 10 minutes, and a majority attempted within just 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>A majority of survivors described their attempt as an impulsive response to an interpersonal conflict, with most reporting they had attempted suicide within 24 hours of a serious argument.</li>
      <li>Though over 9 million Americans experience “serious thoughts of suicide” each year, 30% experience those suicidal thoughts for less than one hour.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Though suicide attempts are typically impulsive, they rarely occur out of the blue. Most people who attempt suicide are grappling with an impairing mental illness like depression or PTSD and exhibit or communicate significant warning signs of suicide risk prior to their attempt.</p>
    <blockquote>Contrary to popular myth, suicidal impulses are almost never permanent desires.</blockquote>
    <p>But contrary to popular myth, suicidal impulses are almost never permanent desires. In fact, the majority of people who start a suicide attempt act to save their own life by aborting the attempt or seeking help before it’s too late. And most people who survive a suicide attempt live out their lives without ever attempting suicide again.</p>
    <p>Understanding that suicide attempts are generally one-time, crisis-driven responses to overwhelming pain is the first step toward crafting an effective policy response. Temporarily reducing at-risk people’s access to the most lethal means of suicide substantially increases their odds of survival in both the short and long term.</p>
    <h2>The Unique Lethality of Guns: Guns are far more lethal than other methods commonly used in suicide attempts in the US
    </h2>
    <p>Most suicide attempts are carried out impulsively using whatever methods are readily accessible. At-risk people who have guns in their home, or who live in states that make guns widely and immediately available to new purchasers, are much more likely to use guns to attempt suicide and, consequently, much more likely to die by suicide. 
    </p>
    <p>This is because guns are <i>uniquely</i> lethal compared to other suicide attempt methods. The human body is remarkably resilient—more than 90% of US suicide attempts are not fatal. But when people reach for firearms in a suicidal crisis, they nearly always die. About 85% of people who attempt suicide with a firearm don’t survive the attempt. Self-inflicted gunshots are at least 42 times more likely to result in death as the most common suicide attempt methods—medication overdoses and sharp instruments. This explains how self-inflicted gunshots have accounted for 5% of life-threatening suicide attempts, but 52% of all suicide deaths since 2000.</p>
    <p>Preventing suicide attempts is critical to reducing US suicide rates. But every year, over a million Americans attempt to take their own life. The presence of a firearm is very often the determining factor in whether a person survives. This means that gun policy reforms have to be part of a comprehensive response to the problem of suicide in America. If just one in ten of the approximately 350,000 individuals who attempted suicide with firearms between 2000 and 2015 had instead attempted suicide by the two most common suicide attempt methods, almost 30,000 more men, women, and children would have survived their suicide attempts instead of dying from their injuries. Nearly 30,000 more families would be whole. The vast majority would have gone on to live out their lives and continue to contribute to our world.</p>
    <h4>[insert sidebar "Why Firearms Play Such a Deadly Role in US Suicides" in some way here]</h4>
    <h3>Other Nations Have Achieved Significant Reductions in Suicide by Reducing Access to the Most Lethal Common Methods of Suicide</h3>
    <p>Other countries have shown that public policy changes can meaningfully reduce national suicide rates by better regulating access to the most lethal method of suicide.</p>
    <p>Before 1960, inhalation of domestic gas (used for heating and cooking) was the leading suicide method in the United Kingdom. After the UK transitioned to a nontoxic source of natural gas, gas suicides fell to nearly zero. Though suicides by other methods moderately increased—evidence that some suicidal people were substituting other means—the overall suicide rate fell by nearly one-third.</p>
    <p>A similar result occurred in Sri Lanka, an agricultural nation where widely accessible pesticides were long the leading method of suicide. After Sri Lanka’s government placed restrictions on the availability of the most highly toxic pesticides in the 1990s, overall suicide rates dropped by half. Researchers found that about the same number of people were still attempting suicide with pesticides and other methods—they just weren’t dying as often.</p>
    <blockquote>After Israeli military leaders implemented a new policy that required soldiers to leave their service weapons on base during weekend leave, military suicide rates dropped by 40%.</blockquote>
    <p>In the past decade, the Israeli Defense Forces also observed that suicides among its soldiers occurred disproportionately on weekends and that the vast majority—roughly 90%—involved firearms. After military leaders implemented a new policy that required soldiers to leave their service weapons on base during weekend leave, military suicide rates dropped by 40%.</p>
    <p>The crucial lesson for American policymakers is that nations can substantially reduce overall suicide rates by regulating the most lethal means commonly used in their population’s suicide attempts. The US will not and should not restrict law-abiding, responsible people from accessing guns. But we can craft targeted policy reforms that help to reduce the likelihood that people in mental crisis will access the most uniquely lethal means of suicide during moments of crisis.</p>
    <h2>Vast Disparities in Suicide Rates Exist Across the US 
    Suicide rates are much, much higher in states and demographic groups where people have easy access to guns</h2>
    <p>Our nation’s recent increase in suicide rates has been broad-based, with rates rising in nearly every state and demographic group since 2000. But while suicide rates are rising across the country, certain portions of the American population suffer vastly more suicide deaths than others. Suicide rates are significantly higher for demographic groups and states with the broadest and easiest access to guns.</p>
    <h3>Gender</h3>
    <p>In the United States, women are almost twice as likely to suffer severe depression as men. They are 40% more likely to report experiencing serious psychological distress in the past month and 61% more likely to suffer from a severely impairing mental health condition. Women are more likely to experience serious thoughts of suicide and are much more likely than men to attempt suicide.</p>
    <p>But men are more than three times more likely to personally own a gun. As a result, when men attempt suicide, they are more than eight times as likely to use firearms, and almost five times as likely to die from the attempt. Although the male population overall has lower rates of depression, psychologic distress, and suicidality, males account for 78% of US suicide deaths.</p>

    <h3>Race</h3>
    <p>Suicide death rates are particularly high among non-Hispanic white and Native American men. White men make up roughly one-third of the US population, but nearly two-thirds of all suicide deaths. Native Americans report the highest rates of serious psychological distress and also have the highest rates of suicide death. But white Americans’ suicide rates are close behind even though, as a whole, white Americans report much lower rates of serious psychological distress than other groups. </p>
    <blockquote>White men make up roughly one-third of the US population, but nearly two-thirds of all suicide deaths</blockquote>
    <p>Gun access helps explain why. White Americans are about twice as likely as black and Hispanic Americans to own a firearm in the home. When attempting suicide, white men are about twice as likely to use firearms as black and Hispanic men and, as a result, they are 2.5 times as likely to die by suicide.</p>
    <p>White women are also two to three times more likely to attempt suicide with firearms than black and Hispanic women. Unsurprisingly, they are more than three times as likely to die by suicide—again, guns are uniquely lethal.</p>
    <h4>[Insert tables and sidebar text here from pg 24-26]</h4>
    <h4>Suicide’s Toll State by State</h4>
    <p>There are also vast disparities in suicide rates among the 50 states. Americans living in Wyoming are about 3.5 times as likely to die by suicide as Americans in New Jersey. Suicide rates are 45% and 69% higher than the national average in the relatively healthy, wealthy, and educated states of Colorado and Utah.</p>
    <p>These disparities exist for minors too. In Alaska, young people aged 10-17 are nearly 3 times as likely to die by suicide as the national average and 5 times as likely to die by suicide as their peers in California. </p>
    <p>The data shows that these vast disparities in suicide risk are almost entirely attributable to differences in <i>firearm</i> suicides. Researchers have consistently found that suicide rates are much higher in states with weak gun laws, where people at risk of suicide are most likely to have easy and immediate access to guns.</p>
    <p>Studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine and the American Journal of Epidemiology in 2008 and 2013 compared suicide rates in the states with the highest and lowest rates of gun ownership. In both studies, the two groups of states were roughly equal in population, and had nearly identical rates of non-firearm suicides. Here’s what they found: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In states with the lowest gun ownership, people were actually roughly 20% more likely to attempt suicide. <strong>But firearm access matters much more.</strong></li>
      <li>States with the highest rates of gun ownership had fewer suicide attempts and essentially equal numbers of non-firearm suicides, but they had four times as many firearm suicides and, as a result, nearly twice as many suicide deaths.</li>
      <li>CDC data also reveals that in states with the highest gun ownership minors were nearly seven times more likely to die by firearm suicide from 2008–14. Minors were, consequently, more than twice as likely to die by suicide over this period. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>[Insert mid-report supplement here]</h4>
    <h2>The Fundamental Importance of Hope: Suicide Prevention Works Because 
    The Prognosis for Most Suicidal People is Hopeful </h2>
    <p>When it comes to suicide, instances of hope, resilience, and recovery occur more often than not. Most people who attempt suicide take action to save their own lives before it is too late or otherwise survive. A meta-analysis of 90 published studies on suicide found that 70 percent of survivors did make another attempt, and more than 90 percent did not go on to die by suicide.</p>
    <p>Survivors of suicide and their loved ones have more opportunities on new platforms to share their experiences and work to reverse the false narrative that suicidal people are beyond saving. For example, in 2013, a young woman in Wisconsin started Project Semicolon as a tribute to her late father, whom she lost to suicide. The project asks anyone who had been affected by suicide to draw or tattoo a semicolon on their wrists as a symbol of hope and love, and as a message of awareness. The project’s website explains: “A semicolon is used when an author could’ve ended a sentence but chose not to. You are the author and the sentence is your life [. . .] Your story is not over.” Tens of thousands of people have participated.</p>
    <p>Social media has helped survivors find a community, and provide insight into the experiences they’ve had. In April 2016, a user on the social-news website Reddit asked suicide survivors what feelings they experienced upon discovering that they had survived their suicide attempts. Within a month, the post garnered 7,500 responses from survivors sharing their powerful stories of resilience and hope. Nearly all of them emphasized the possibility and purpose of recovery. </p>
    <blockquote>Despite common misconceptions and gun lobby spin, suicide deaths are not inevitable. In fact, they are the exception, even for suicidal people who are most at risk.</blockquote>
    <p>These survivors are real-life examples of the power of hope, and their stories emphasize the importance of thoughtful, responsible suicide prevention policy in two ways: </p>
    <p>First, they show why suicide prevention matters, what is really at stake. Despite common misconceptions and gun lobby spin, suicide deaths are not inevitable. In fact, they are the exception, even for suicidal people who are most at risk.</p>
    <p>Second, there is a notable silence in these stories of recovery: among these survivors, almost no one could discuss living through a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Those who pulled the trigger of a gun are simply not with us to share stories of second chances and of authoring the next sentence of an unfinished life. </p>
    <p>That’s why effective gun policy matters on this issue. If we believe human lives and talents are precious, and we know suicides are preventable, thoughtful gun safety strategies must be part of a comprehensive response to this public health crisis.</p>
