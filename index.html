      <p class="introtext">For too long, suicide has been the unspeakable problem—a national public health crisis discussed mostly in whispers and euphemisms, wrapped in shame and misconceptions. A culture of silence and stigma has obscured, and in many ways exacerbated, suicide’s devastating toll.</p>
      <p>In truth, a staggering number of American families have lost a loved one to suicide. Since 2002, over half a <i>million</i> American men, women, and children have taken their own lives. People instinctively fear external threats—a drunk driver on the road, a violent attacker, a deadly slip—but more Americans now die by suicide than in car crashes, murders, or falls. Our nation loses nearly three times as many young people aged 10-24 to suicide as to cancer. And US suicide rates are rising by the year. 
      </p>
      <p>Suicide is also the untold story of gun violence in America. From 2000 to 2015, nearly 300,000 Americans intentionally took their own life with a gun—many using a weapon they had acquired for self-protection. Three in five firearm deaths are now suicides. And half of all suicides result from self-inflicted gunshots. And yet the link between gun access and suicide risk remains dangerously misunderstood.</p>
      <p>These are understandably difficult subjects for many people. But this report on suicide in America is—perhaps unexpectedly—about hope and possibility, as much as heartbreak and loss. The simple, hopeful truth is that suicide is preventable. There is a clear path to progress. Even modest public policy reforms and targeted interventions can make a lifesaving difference for many. 
      </p>
      <p>For these prevention efforts to succeed, we have to thoroughly refute the dangerous, stubborn myth that suicide is inevitable. The most damaging myth about suicide is that people who attempt it have reached a deliberate point of no return—that they are determined to die despite anyone’s best efforts. This fatalism generates apathy and inaction, but is usually wrong. The vast majority of people who attempt suicide either survive or abort the attempt. And the vast majority of those survivors live out their lives without ever attempting suicide again. Up to 16 million Americans alive today have survived a suicide attempt. These survivors’ stories are ones of hope and resilience. They were not inevitably lost.

      <p>But very few people can speak of surviving a self-inflicted gunshot. People typically attempt suicide during acute crisis periods, using whatever methods they can quickly obtain. Most survive or abort the attempt. But those who reach for a gun in these desperate moments almost always die. People are at least 42 times more likely to die if they attempt suicide with a gun instead of the two most common methods—medication overdoses and sharp instruments. This explains why gunshots account for 5% of life-threatening suicide <i>attempts</i> in the United States but over 50% of suicide <i>deaths</i>. This is also why states with immediate, unrestricted access to guns suffer a hugely disproportionate share of our nation’s suicide tragedies. 
      </p>
      <blockquote>People are at least 42 times more likely to die if they attempt suicide with a gun instead of the two most common methods.</blockquote>
      <p>Any meaningful effort to reduce suicides in America must reflect these facts. A variety of risk factors—including mental health conditions and trauma, addiction and isolation, bullying and abuse—may drive people to attempt suicide. But easy access to guns is often the determining factor in whether a person survives. 
      </p>
      <p>The director of the American Association of Suicidology has called suicide “the invisible kid sister” in gun policy debates. That must change.  If we believe human life is precious, and that responsible societies act to protect it, we share a collective duty to turn silence and misunderstanding into empathy and action. Gun policy reforms must be part of a comprehensive response to suicide in America. 
      </p>
      <p>In a powerful essay published in <i>Vogue</i> last year, a Minnesota grandmother named Diane Sellgren gave voice to this hope and explained how she became an advocate for gun policy reforms following her daughter’s tragic suicide:
      </p>
      <p><i>My daughter Angela was a beautiful, fun-loving person. She adored her three children and her entire family, and was always the first to offer help to others… Angela also suffered greatly. In the last year of her life, she was hospitalized four times for severe depression and mental illness. Each stay averaged about two weeks. In those times in the hospital, and the days and weeks in between, she was put on many different medications, underwent electroshock therapy, consulted with psychiatrists and other doctors, and participated in group therapy… Depression was not new to our family. Angela’s father suffered from depression, and when she was only 5 years old, he took his life with a gun. 
      </i></p>
      <p><i>On May 5, 2011, two days shy of her 31st birthday, Angela went to a gun store near my home and bought a gun. Two months later, on the 26th anniversary of her father’s suicide by gun, she checked into a hotel and ended her life… I was notified the next day by the coroner’s office that my daughter was gone forever. 
      </i></p>
      <blockquote>One of the most difficult things for me to grasp was that my daughter’s medications were better regulated than the guns and bullets she used to end her life.</blockquote>
      <p><i>One of the most difficult things for me to grasp was that my daughter’s medications were better regulated than the guns and bullets she used to end her life. I was shocked to learn how loopholes in our laws allow people who pose a danger to themselves or others to easily purchase firearms in this country… 
      </i></p>
      <p><i>At her funeral, a relative had the audacity to tell me we have enough gun laws in this country. At that moment, I knew I had to fight for change... It is so important to me, and to all those who have had someone taken from them, that our loved ones are acknowledged, that others know how important their existence was on this earth... I know it’s too late to save Angela. But if I can help spare the next mother the pain of losing her daughter, I will never give up.
      </i></p>
      <p>Gun politics can be contentious. But the vast majority of Americans, including gun owners, agree that we can honor the value and tradition of gun ownership in this country while also placing our thumb more firmly on the scale for human life. That is what we are fighting for—because on this issue, false assumptions, apathy, and inaction have enormous costs. And those costs are not abstract data points but specific, singular people with inherent human dignity and worth.</p>
      <p>This report will promote a frank and informed discussion about how we can act to save more lives from suicide. By forcefully rejecting the myth that suicides are inevitable and implementing the gun policy reforms and interventions detailed in these pages, we can begin to reverse deadly trends and reduce the devastating prevalence of suicide in America.
