    <h1>Suicides Are Not Inevitable
    </h1>
    <p>It’s easy to understand why suicide is so commonly and so deeply misunderstood. Many people only hear about it in obituaries or news accounts filled with innuendo, steeped in a deep cultural legacy of stigma and false assumptions. 
    </p>
    <p>The language we use to speak about suicide shows how entrenched this legacy is. Most people still habitually describe suicide as an act a person “commits,” language that harkens back to when the law treated suicide as a <i>crime</i> a person <i>committed</i> against his or her king and church. Through the eighteenth century, people who died by suicide were buried in disgrace on public highways with a stake impaling their body; suicide attempt survivors could face criminal prosecution. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>US federal law <i>still</i> makes it a serious crime for members of the Armed Forces to intentionally injure themselves in a suicide attempt.</blockquote>
    <p>Modern society has, thankfully, advanced a great deal, but views about mental illness and suicide are still fraught with stigma and misunderstanding. After all, US federal law <i>still</i> makes it a serious crime for members of the Armed Forces to intentionally injure themselves in a suicide attempt. The conversation that follows a public figure’s suicide often reinforces popular misconceptions too. Some accuse the deceased of being fatally selfish, weak, or attention seeking. Others, especially in art or music, perpetuate a counter-narrative that romanticizes suicide as a clean, philosophical gesture. Survivors’ voices are seldom heard. 
    </p>
    <p> These false narratives obscure some basic truths about suicide in America.
    </p>
    <p>People who attempt suicide are usually desperate and in crisis, overwhelmed by excruciating mental pain and illness. 90% of people who attempt suicide are grappling with a mental health condition, like major depression or PTSD. Their attempts are not romantic or weak, but a symptom of disease.
    </p>
    <blockquote>Three to five percent of the US population—10 to 16 million people alive today—have survived a suicide attempt.</blockquote>
    <p>These people are not a small, hopeless fringe. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1.3 <i>million</i> Americans attempt suicide each year—twice as many people as live in our nation’s capital. Three to five percent of the US population—10 to 16 million people alive today—have survived a suicide attempt. 
    </p>
    <p>Though most suicidal people are suffering from a mental health condition, their desire for death is usually temporary—an impulsive, desperate reaction to acute crises like a breakup, or the loss of a job or loved one. Most people act on these impulses quickly and with little planning: 71% people attempt suicide within an hour of deciding to do so and up to 48% attempt within 10 minutes. Most people survive or abort suicide attempts and never attempt suicide again. This fact is crucial. The prognosis for most suicidal people is hopeful. Most people who struggle with severe long-term depression and recurring suicidal thoughts cope and survive.</p>

    <p>But people who attempt suicide with a gun almost never have the chance to do so.</p>
    <h1>Gun Access Plays a Major Role in Suicide Risk</h1>
    <p>Suicide subverts many of the conventional narratives of America’s gun debate. The gun violence prevention movement has—with notable exceptions—typically highlighted the threats Americans face when other, violent people are armed. This has made it easier to talk about smart-on-crime policies to curb the illegal gun trade than to have a sustained discussion about the growing proportion of gun deaths in our country in which the shooter is also the victim.</p>

    <p>Frank discussions about suicide are even harder for the corporate gun lobby, which has long denied any link between gun access and suicide. It’s not difficult to imagine why. The gun lobby represents corporations whose essential purpose is to profit by manufacturing and selling as many weapons to as many people as possible. These corporations are predictably reluctant to acknowledge that their products carry significant risks for the average consumer. Instead, their messaging and product advertisements legitimize just one fear: that a person without a gun is powerless and unprepared. </p>
    <p>John Lott, a gun activist whose discredited research has often been cited by the gun lobby, told the <i>Washington Post</i> last July that some lawmakers were “wrongfully assuming guns actually contribute to suicide.” Firearms “aren’t a factor in the suicide rate,” he claimed, because “in the absence of guns, people will instead choose a different suicide method and carry it through to completion.” This claim was not new. Nearly two decades ago, another gun lobby favorite named Gary Kleck published a purported “summary of the field” of gun violence research in which he claimed that, “While gun ownership levels are consistently related to the rate of gun suicides, they are unrelated to total suicide rate. That is, where guns are common, people will more frequently use them to kill themselves, but this does not affect the total number of people who die.” </p>
    <p>The NRA has often propagated these claims. A typical NRA “news” alert about suicide told readers, “When life means nothing, laws mean even less… In the absence of firearms, suicidal people simply substitute other means.” A director of research for the NRA dismissed suicide prevention efforts by telling the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, “If a person is determined to kill himself, he will find a way.”</p>
    <p>These claims are demonstrably and unequivocally false.</p>
    <p>Last year, <i>Vox</i> fact checkers reported that “every single case control study done in the United States has found the presence of a firearm in the home is a strong risk factor for suicide.” They cited 24 separate studies as well as a 2014 meta-analysis of 16 studies, published in the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>, that found “gun availability <i>tripled</i> the overall risk of suicide.” The scientific consensus on this issue is clear:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A 2014 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine noted that “all US case-control studies that have examined the issue have found that the risk of suicide is two- to fivefold higher in gun-owning homes for all household members… The higher suicide risk is driven by a higher risk of firearm suicide, with no difference in non-gun suicides."</li>
      <li>• A 2011 paper published in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine conducted a meta-analysis of 15 case-control studies found that “all [of the studies] find that firearms in the home are associated with substantially and significantly higher rates of suicide” and that “having any gun in the home is a risk factor for suicide for everyone in the home—the gun owner, the gun owner’s spouse, and the gun owner’s children.”</li>
      <li>A 2004 study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, which analyzed CDC data from a large national sample of recent death records, found that males were over 10 times more likely to have died by suicide if they had lived in a home with a gun. Overall, recently deceased Americans were six times more likely to have died by suicide if they had lived in a home with a gun.</li>
      <li>A 2003 study published in the Journal of Injury Prevention found that people who died by suicide were nearly seven times as likely as the general population to have purchased a handgun within the previous two years.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Medical and public health professionals have also consistently rejected the gun lobby’s claims about firearms and suicide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The American Association of Suicidology has made clear that easy access to firearms is “a contributory risk factor for suicides and suicidal behaviors.”</li>
      <li>The American Academy of Pediatrics has repeatedly affirmed that “adolescent suicide risk is strongly associated with firearm availability” and that “the association of a gun in the home and increased risk of suicide among adolescents has been well documented."</li>
      <li>In 2015, the American Bar Association and eight public health and medical professional organizations jointly signed a declaration that acknowledged the scientific consensus that “substantial evidence indicates that firearms increase the likelihood of suicide.” This conclusion was endorsed by the American College of Physicians, the American College of Surgeons, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and the American Public Health Association. The American Medical Association signed this call to action the following year.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), which represents thousands of gun dealers and manufacturers, recently acknowledged this link between firearm access and suicide risk. Last year, the NSSF announced a partnership with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) to distribute educational materials about reducing suicide risk at gun shops in select states. This voluntary education campaign is an important first step and could lead to other opportunities for common ground, particularly in reaching</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, though, the NSSF has made clear that it is not open to any discussion about how gun policy reforms could save lives from suicide. In the press release announcing its suicide prevention initiative, NSSF’s CEO wrote that, “to AFSP’s credit, it has . . . completely set aside the contentious politics surrounding the subject of firearms. That approach has made it possible for NSSF to enter into this promising partnership and has led to an open exchange of ideas.”</p>
    <p>Contentious or not, “the subject of firearms” is a critical part of any actually open and meaningful discussion about suicide in America. A strong body of research confirms that there is a clear link between firearm access and drastically increased rates of suicide. And even modest gun policy reforms could make a lifesaving difference.</p>
